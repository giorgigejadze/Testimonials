        <h3 class="h">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned <br> were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I <br> honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</h3>
        <p class="was">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a <br> transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for <br> the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 <br> weeks was the  best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve <br> successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

        <h3 class="such">Such a life-changing <br> experience. Highly <br> recommended!</h3>
        <p class="before">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve <br> never written a line of code. I needed <br> some structure from professionals <br> who can help me learn programming <br> step by step. I was encouraged to <br> enroll by a former student of theirs <br> who can only say wonderful things <br> about the program. The entire <br> curriculum and staff did not <br> disappoint. They were very hands-on <br> and I never had to wait long for <br> assistance. The agile team project, in <br> particular, was outstanding. It took <br> my learning to the next level in a way <br> that no tutorial could ever have. In <br> fact, I’ve often referred to it during <br> interviews as an example of my <br> developent experience. It certainly <br> helped me land a job as a full-stack <br> developer after receiving multiple <br> offers. 100% recommend!  ”</p>

        <h3 class="awesome">Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp <br> themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning from <br> their experiences was easy.</h3>
        <p class="staff">“ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The <br> program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present <br> myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the <br> personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people.  ”</p>
